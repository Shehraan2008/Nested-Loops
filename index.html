            <strong>Whether</strong> is what the forecasters on the TV news
            predict each day. They tell people about the temperature,
            cloudiness, humidity, and whether a storm is likely in the next few
            days. That‚Äôs weather! It is the mix of events that happens each day
            in our atmosphere. Weather is not the same everywhere. It may be hot
            and sunny in one part of the world, but freezing and snowy in
            another.

            <strong>Climate</strong> is the average weather in a place over many
            years. While the weather can change in just a few hours, climate
            takes hundreds, thousands, even millions of years to change.

                  In short, climate is the description of the long-term pattern
                  of weather in a particular area. Some scientists define
                  climate as the average weather for a particular region and
                  time period, usually taken over 30-years. It's really an
                  average pattern of weather for a particular region. When
                  scientists talk about climate, they're looking at averages of
                  precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind velocity,
                  phenomena such as fog, frost, and hail storms, and other
                  measures of the weather that occur over a long period in a
                  particular place. For example, after looking at rain gauge
                  data, lake and reservoir levels, and satellite data,
                  scientists can tell if during a summer, an area was drier than
                  average. If it continues to be drier than normal over the
                  course of many summers, than it would likely indicate a change
                  in the climate.

                  Weather is basically the way the atmosphere is behaving,
                  mainly with respect to its effects upon life and human
                  activities. The difference between weather and climate is that
                  weather consists of the short-term (minutes to months) changes
                  in the atmosphere. Most people think of weather in terms of
                  temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, brightness,
                  visibility, wind, and atmospheric pressure, as in high and low
                  pressure. In most places, weather can change from
                  minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and
                  season-to-season. Climate, however, is the average of weather
                  over time and space. An easy way to remember the difference is
                  that climate is what you expect, like a very hot summer, and
                  weather is what you get, like a hot day with pop-up
                  thunderstorms.

              <dt>Tilt of the Earth</dt>
              <dd>
                - The angle Earth‚Äôs axis of rotation is tilted as it travels
                around the Sun is known as obliquity. Obliquity is why Earth has
                seasons. Over the last million years, it has varied between 22.1
                and 24.5 degrees perpendicular to Earth‚Äôs orbital plane. The
                greater Earth‚Äôs axial tilt angle, the more extreme our seasons
                are, as each hemisphere receives more solar radiation during its
                summer, when the hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and less
                during winter, when it is tilted away. Larger tilt angles favor
                periods of deglaciation (the melting and retreat of glaciers and
                ice sheets). These effects aren‚Äôt uniform globally -- higher
                latitudes receive a larger change in total solar radiation than
                areas closer to the equator. Earth‚Äôs axis is currently tilted
                23.4 degrees, or about half way between its extremes, and this
                angle is very slowly decreasing in a cycle that spans about
                41,000 years.

              <dd>
                - As ocean water gets warmer due to climate, seawater expands
                thereby raising sea levels and changing the ocean‚Äôs circulation
                and even exerting more pressure on the ocean floor below in some
                areas, explained Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute in
                Germany. These pressure changes won‚Äôt be uniform across the
                globe, because global warming will cause the ocean to warm more
                in some places than in others.

              <dd>
                - Temperatures drop the further an area is from the equator due
                to the curvature of the earth. In areas closer to the poles,
                sunlight has a larger area of atmosphere to pass through and the
                sun is at a lower angle in the sky. As a result, more energy is
                lost and temperatures are cooler.

              <dt>Altitude</dt>
              <dd>
                - Locations at a higher altitude have colder temperatures.
                Temperature usually decreases by 1¬∞C for every 100 metres in
                altitude.

              <dd>
                - Oceans heat up and cool down much more slowly than land. This
                means that coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and
                warmer in winter than places inland at the same latitude and
                altitude. Glasgow, for example, is at a similar latitude to
                Moscow, but is much milder in winter because it is nearer to the
                coast than Moscow.

            <li>
              <dt>Winds</dt>
              <dd>
                - The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a
                location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the
                South West, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic
                Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When
                prevailing winds blow over land areas it can contribute to
                creating desert climates.
